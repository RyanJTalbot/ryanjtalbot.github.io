      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently using Michael Hatl's Learn Enough to Be Dangerous 
        <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> along with his 
        other tutorials. They're not free and are probably a little advanced for me 
        but find them very informative with a lot of hands on learning. 
        
        href="http://learnenough.com/css-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough CSS and Layout 
        to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <strong>C</strong>
        ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets, the language that 
        allows web pages to be styled. Other related tutorials can be found at 
        <a href="http://learnenough.com/">learnenough.com</a>.

    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee 
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication 
      taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, 
      and probably more.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility, Michael
            is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the 
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/"> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> 
            introductory sequence.

            Michael is also
            notorious as the founder of <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and
            author of <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau 
            Manifesto </em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are 
            slightly exaggerated.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes 
            on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the 
            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            I Started with learning Ruby via a free bootcamp with App Academy

            pique my interest in programming.
