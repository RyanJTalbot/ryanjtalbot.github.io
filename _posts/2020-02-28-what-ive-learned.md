I began learning to code in May of 2019, which is about 10 months ago.
I began with AppAcademy's free bootcamp prep course for Ruby.

Then I moved to Michael Hatel's <italics>Learn Enough Rails to be Dangers.</italics> I followed that up with his other courses which are: command line, terminal, github, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

From there I began a front end development track with <italics>Treehouse.</italics> The track is made up of numerous courses dealing with front end development. The total duration of the Track is about 70 hours. 

My next move is to do NuCamp's courses.
