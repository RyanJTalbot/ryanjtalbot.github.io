It's a crazy time in the world right now. The uncertainty is palpable from the parochial to global level. People in the USA are being told contradiciting information from government agencies and the current administraition in the White House. 

I'm still going into work despite my unease with being out and about on a daily basis. Its strange to drive to and from work because there are very few people on the roads. Around late morning everyone goes out to pillage the grocery store until they close. 

It's a great time to stay home and learn more about programming and staying busy.
