I had my second Nucamp Video conference yesterday. For my course I have a 4 hour live online class once a week, followed by a list of execises and videos to watch during the week. We have covered html and css and are now starting on javascript.

 The price for a front-end bootcamp is $1,372 for 17 weeks or the full stack bootcamp which is $1,765 for 22 weeks, which are some of the cheapest I've seen. I haven't looked in awhile but I think the others are in the ball park of $10,000. I can't say I'm impressed by the current 4 week bootcamp ($349) but I'm not disapointed either. 

 Coronavirus update: It looks like I might get to do some extra programming for the next week or two because I will be "working" from home starting tomorrow. It seems there are still people not taking the virus seriously but their is so much hoarding we can't get toilet paper anywhere, not even amazon.
