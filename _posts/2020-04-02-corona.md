I think this is about day 10 of Quarintine. In Louisiana there are currently 9,150 reporeted cases, 310 Deaths, 1,639 individuals in the hospital with 507 of those on ventilators.

I currently still have a job, but the owner will give me some busy work every few days. In my opinion, I think its to keep me off unemployment. I'm not sure which is more benefitical to me monitarily, But right now I think it would be the unemployment.
