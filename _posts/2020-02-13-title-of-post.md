I am going back and forth between the <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/" target="_blank">Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a> website and the 
<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>  website. 

As for Hartls' site I have completed or nearly completed all of his tutorials with the exception of the Ruby on Rails tutorial and another which he just released.

Treehosue has endless resources and tutorials. You can choose between individual lessons or courses or tracks. I am currently doing the <i>front-end development</i> track. It consists of numerous courses consisting mainly of 
<strong>CSS, HTLM, JavaScript</strong>. Treehouse can be monotonous at time but they wallk you through everything in detail. They have a built in code editor that links to the website you are currently building, so it is benifitial to beginers.
