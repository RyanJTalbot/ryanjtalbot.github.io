I am going back and forth between Michael Hartls' website and the Treehouse website. 

As for Hartls' site I have completed or nearly completed all of his tutorials with the exception of the Ruby on Rails tutorial and another which he just released.

<a href="https//:teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> 
has endless resources and tutorials. You can choose between individual lessons or courses or tracks. I am currently doing the <itlaic>front-end development</italic> track. It consists of numerous courses consisting mainly of 
<em>CSS, HTLM, JavaScript</em>. Treehouse can be monotonous at time but they wallk you through everything in detail. They have a built in code editor that links to the website you are currently building, so it is benifitial to beginers.
