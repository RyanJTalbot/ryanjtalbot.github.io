I"t<p>Yesterday was my first day working from home during the coronavirus. I touched based with a few clients but nothing is going on with them because everything is shut down except for essential wokers.</p>

<p>Also today is my Birthday, I though I treat myself to some toilet paper but walmart and albertsons were out. Yesterday I tried a couple discount/dollar stores without any luck either.</p>

<p>This is what the USA looks like this morning. <img src="/images/3-24-2020coronavirus.jpg" id="corona" alt="The coronavirus map of usa as of today" width="712" height="354" /></p>

<p>Because work will be basically non-existant for the next three weeks I will spending most of my working hours doing computer programming.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was stuck on a problem for hours in my Nucamp homework on JavaScript. This is what it was/
…<br /></p>

<p>Learning a new JavaScript statement: Switch</p>

<p>The JavaScript “Switch” statement is covered briefly in this course, and yet we ask you to use it in this code challenge. Why? Because this introduces you to the need for any developer, junior or with decades of experience, to learn new languages, features and ways to code. Research is a skill that you will need to master as a developer, and it will take many forms: you will read the documentation, reproduce tutorials, watch videos, and once you start writing a few lines of code read stack overflow to understand how to make it work.</p>

<p>What’s important in this challenge is as much the process of discovering something new and learning it online, as it is to successfully finish the challenge.</p>

<p>Recommendation: Start with the resources at the bottom of the page, and then continue on with the challenge.</p>

<p>Using Codepen.io
For this coding exercise, we will be using the website Codepen.io. Codepen is what’s called a ‘code playground’ - there are other sites that function in the same way. They allow you to play and experiment with snippets of code online, and it’s especially useful in a class setting since that means we can share code with each other without needing to exchange files.</p>

<p>You will need to create an account at Codepen, which is free. There is a short introductory tutorial you can take, if you like. Once you are signed in, click here to access the Codepen for this exercise, then use the “Fork” button at the bottom right to copy it to your account.</p>

<p>Read the instructions and update the code that’s in the JS section of the Codepen. You will not need to change anything in the HTML or CSS sections.</p>

<p>Click the “Console” button at the bottom left of your Codepen in order to see the console.log output.</p>

<p>Instructions
In the JS section is a partially created function named getDailyGoal().</p>

<p>Inside this function, the variables you need have already been created for you.
The numbers 0-6 correlate to the day of the week, where 0 is Monday, 1 is Tuesday … 6 is Sunday.</p>

<p>Challenge 1
Inside the currently empty parentheses in line 2, write a JavaScript expression that checks that the course is “Intro”. Use what you have learned about if statements in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Challenge 2
Next, you will use what you have learned about the switch statement in JavaScript. Go to line 3 and delete the text ‘Your challenge 2 switch code here’. In its place, write a switch statement as follows:</p>

<p>The switch statement will evaluate the day variable.
For both cases 0 and 1, it will execute this code: return “Study up to ‘Basics of JavaScript’.”;
With careful placement, you should only need to write this line once for both cases.
For case 2, it will execute this code: return “Finish through ‘Basics of JavaScript’ today.”;
For case 3, it will execute this code: return “Finish through ‘Handling Data’ today.”;
For case 4, it will execute this code: return “Finish through ‘Further Resources’ today.”;
For case 5, it will execute this code: return “It’s time for our first JavaScript Workshop!”;
For case 6, it will execute this code: return “Start on Week 4 today.”;
For the default case, it will execute this code: return “Unknown day.”;</p>
