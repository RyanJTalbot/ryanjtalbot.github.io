I"p<p>I started NuCamp’s 4 week course for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript last week. 
I have found that its good for me to brush up on my html and css and hoping to learn a lot when I get to the JavaScript portion of the course. I can’t say its an amazing way to learn a language but I can’t say its bad either. I’m still making up my mind on how I feel about it.</p>
