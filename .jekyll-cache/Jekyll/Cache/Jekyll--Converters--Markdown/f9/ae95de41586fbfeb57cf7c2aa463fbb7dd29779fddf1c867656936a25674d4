I"<p>I think this is about day 10 of Quarintine. In Louisiana there are currently 9,150 reporeted cases, 310 Deaths, 1,639 individuals in the hospital with 507 of those on ventilators.</p>

<p>I currently still have a job, but the owner will give me some busy work every few days. In my opinion, I think its to keep me off unemployment. Iâ€™m not sure which is more benefitical to me monitarily, But right now I think it would be the unemployment.</p>
