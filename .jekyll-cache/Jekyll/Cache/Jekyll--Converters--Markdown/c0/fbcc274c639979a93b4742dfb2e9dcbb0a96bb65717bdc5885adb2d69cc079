I"•<p>I started to learn to program in May 2019, which was
about 10 months ago now.</p>

<p>I began with AppAcademys free bootcamp prep course.</p>

<p>eventually moved on to Michael Hartlâ€™s <italics>Learn Enough Rails to be Dangerous</italics> tutorial,
which lead me to taking his other courses on HTML, CSS, GitHub, Text editor, Console, and JavaScript.
From there I began the Treehouse <strong>Front End Development Track</strong>. This
Track is made up of about 20 or so courses for a total of 70 hours.</p>

<p>I also play with other short lessons or tutorials from other places as well.
Because of the importance to know Github, Iâ€™ve done some of their tutorials as well, which are invaluble to anyone
wanting to program.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve recently signed up for NuCamps Web Development Fundamentals. After this I plan to take their
either their front end web + Mobile development course or their full stack web + Mobile development course. the
first course is 17 weeks long while the sencond is 22 weeks long.</p>

<p>The only reason I am starting with the web development fundamentals course 
is because I have limited experience with JavaScript which NuCamp leans on isntead of Ruby.</p>

<p>In my opinion the most important thing is to always be learning. In the past
10 monhts, Iâ€™ve only had 1 day where I havenâ€™t done any type of programming. 
You can believe I had a good reason for not programming that day.</p>
