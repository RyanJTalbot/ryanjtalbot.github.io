I"k<p>I began learning to code in May of 2019, which is about 10 months ago.
I began with AppAcademy’s free bootcamp prep course for Ruby.</p>

<p>Then I moved to Michael Hatel’s <italics>Learn Enough Rails to be Dangers.</italics> I followed that up with his other courses which are: command line, terminal, github, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>From there I began a front end development track with <italics>Treehouse.</italics> The track is made up of numerous courses dealing with front end development. The total duration of the Track is about 70 hours.</p>

<p>My next move is to do NuCamp’s courses.</p>
