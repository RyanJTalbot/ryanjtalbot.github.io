I"E<p>Yesterday was my first day working from home during the coronavirus. I touched based with a few clients but nothing is going on with them because everything is shut down except for essential wokers.</p>

<p>Also today is my Birthday, I though I treat myself to some toilet paper but walmart and albertsons were out. Yesterday I tried a couple discount/dollar stores without any luck either.</p>

<p>This is what the USA looks like this morning. <img src="/images/3-24-2020coronavirus.jpg" id="corona" alt="The coronavirus map of usa as of today" width="722" height="454" /></p>
