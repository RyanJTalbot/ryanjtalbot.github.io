I",<p>I started NuCamp’s 4 week course for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript last week. 
I have found that its good for me to brush up on my html and css and hoping to learn a lot when I get to the JavaScript portion of the course. I can’t say its an amazing way to learn a language but I can’t say its bad either. I’m still making up my mind on how I feel about it.</p>

<p>Because I try to do some type of coding everyday for 1-2 hours, I still have time to do other projects and courses. Also, I’ve been toying with the idea of building a website without following a tutorial.</p>

<p>Long story short, A client made this <a href="http://fbcrichmondpark.com/">website</a> in 2004 and I think it needs an update. I plan on redoing the website from scratch without knowing how theirs was originally created.</p>
